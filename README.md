Overview

Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It predicts the probability of an outcome and maps it to a class such as 0 or 1, Yes or No, Pass or Fail.

How It Works

The model uses a sigmoid function to convert linear values into probabilities between 0 and 1. Based on a threshold (usually 0.5), the final class label is decided.
